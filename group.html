 <h2>This project was made with Constituting America.</h2>

 <p class="blurb">
  Constituting America is a non-profit organization that helps Americans—especially students—learn about the 
  U.S. Constitution and why it matters today. It was founded by actress and political commentator Janine Turner 
  along with co-chair Cathy Gillespie. The group offers educational programs, podcasts, contests, and free resources 
  to help people understand how the Constitution protects our freedoms and shapes our government.
</p>

<p class="blurb">
  Each year, they host a scholarship contest where students can submit essays, videos, songs, and artwork about 
  the Constitution for a chance to win prizes and national recognition. Their goal is to inspire young Americans to 
  be active, informed citizens.
