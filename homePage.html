 <h1 class="page_title">Learn about the Constitution</h1>
 <p class="blurb">The Constitution is the document that protects the rights of all Americans. The United States Constitution was 
  written in 1787 to build a strong but balanced national government after the American Revolution. It replaced the 
  Articles of Confederation, which had left the country too weak and divided. Written by leaders like James Madison 
  and George Washington, the Constitution created three branches of government, legislative, executive, and judicial, 
  setting up a system of checks and balances to prevent any one part from becoming too powerful. It's often called a “living 
  ocument” because it can change and grow through amendments and court decisions to meet the needs of each new generation. Even after more than 230 years, it still shapes how our government works and protects the rights of the people.</p>
